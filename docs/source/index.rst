Welcome to the CHORAS backend documentation
=================================================
----

This is the backend implementation documentation for the Community Hub for Open-source Room Acoustics Software (CHORAS).

The software uses the `Acoustic Diffusion Equation (DE) Method <https://github.com/Building-acoustics-TU-Eindhoven/Diffusion>`_ and `Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Method <https://github.com/Building-acoustics-TU-Eindhoven/edg-acoustics>`_ as sub-modules for modeling of sound behaviour in complex geometrical spaces.

Please follow the steps provided here to setup the CHORAS backend.
