Creating a mesh from geometry using Gmsh
========================================

CHORAS uses Gmsh to create meshes. Gmsh provides a scripting language or serves
as an API to geometry creation tools to define geometries and mesh them.
This example assumes that the geometry has been defined and is provided in
a Gmsh ``*.geo`` file.

For more information on Gmsh, please refer to the `Gmsh documentation
<https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html#Gmsh-application-programming-interface>`_.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import gmsh
import matplotlib.tri as mtri

# %%
# For Gmsh to work, it always needs to be initialized first.
gmsh.initialize()
# %%
# Subsequently, the geometry file can be imported using the following function.
# Note that the function does not return anything, but the geometry is
# imported into the Gmsh model.
gmsh.open("example_room.geo")

# Creating a surface mesh
# -----------------------
#
# Gmsh supports meshing in 1D, 2D, and 3D. For surfaces, a 2D mesh is
# appropriate.
# In Gmsh surface meshes can be accessed using
dim = 2

# %%
# Different element types can be set using:
element_type = gmsh.model.mesh.getElementType("triangle", 1)

# %%
# In Gmsh, different parts of the geometry can be grouped using
# *Physical Groups*. These can be used to identify different parts of the
# geometry and assign boundary conditions or material properties.
# The names of all surface groups can be accessed using:
surface_group_tags = gmsh.model.getPhysicalGroups(dim=dim)
surface_group_names = [
    gmsh.model.getPhysicalName(element_type, tag)
    for (element_type, tag) in surface_group_tags
]

# %%
# To generate the surface mesh from the surface geometry, the following
# function can be used.
gmsh.model.mesh.generate(dim)

# %%
# The Cartesian coordinates of all mesh nodes can be accessed using the
# following functions.
# All functions return the ids of the nodes as well as their coordinates as
# flat array.
# Accordingly, the coordinates need to be reshaped to a (N, 3) array for
# further processing.
node_tags_all, coords_all, _ = gmsh.model.mesh.getNodes()
coords = coords_all.reshape((len(node_tags_all), 3))


# %%
# To access the nodes belonging to a specific surface group using their name,
# the following functions can be used to access the node ids for the triangular
# surface mesh elements.
# Note that the node ids start at 1 instead of python's indexing which starts
# at 0.
mesh_kind = 3
dim_tags = gmsh.model.getEntitiesForPhysicalName(surface_group_names[0])
_, node_tags_group = dim_tags[0]

face_nodes = gmsh.model.mesh.getElementFaceNodes(
    dim, mesh_kind, tag=node_tags_group)
faces = np.reshape(face_nodes, (len(face_nodes) // mesh_kind, mesh_kind))
# %%
# The mesh of the first surface group can be visualized using matplotlib.
# Note again that the node ids start at 1, hence the need to subtract 1 for
# numpy and matplotlib indexing.

tri_plotting = mtri.Triangulation(
    coords[:, 0],
    coords[:, 1],
    faces-1
)

ax = plt.axes()
ax.scatter(coords[faces-1, 0], coords[faces-1, 1], color="gray")
ax.triplot(tri_plotting, color="gray")
plt.show()
